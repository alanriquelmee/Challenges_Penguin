# 🇵🇾 Challenge 2 – Didactic Maze with BFS & Backtracking

This project is part of the Penguin Academy intensive program. It combines classic pathfinding algorithms with cultural education.

## 🎯 Objective

Solve mazes using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Backtracking** to help the player reach the exit.  
Each time the maze is solved, a **fragment of the Paraguayan national anthem** is revealed, making it an interactive and educational experience.

## 🧪 Technologies

- Language: C++
- Algorithms: BFS (for shortest path), Backtracking (for solving multiple paths)
- Output: Console (text-based)

## 🗺️ Features

- Randomly generated mazes
- Clear visual output in the terminal
- Cultural reward system (displaying hymn fragments)

## ▶️ How to Compile & Run

Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (like `g++`):

```bash
g++ Challenge2_Bfs_Backtracking.cpp -o hymn_maze
./hymn_maze
