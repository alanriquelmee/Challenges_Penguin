# 🧱 Challenge 4 – Object-Oriented Maze Solver with BFS (Pygame)

This challenge is a **refactored version** of Challenge 3, improving code structure by applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.

The maze solver still uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Pygame** for visualization, but the logic is now divided into clean, reusable classes.

## 🎯 Objective

Refactor a BFS maze solver into a modular structure using Python classes. The algorithm and rendering are now handled through dedicated objects, improving scalability and maintainability.

## 🧪 Technologies

- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame
- Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming
- Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

## 🧱 Key Classes

- `Maze`: Generates and stores the grid
- `Cell`: Represents each tile in the maze
- `Solver`: Executes BFS algorithm
- `Renderer`: Handles Pygame drawing and updates

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install pygame
