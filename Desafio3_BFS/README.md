# 🧭 Challenge 3 – Maze Solver with BFS (Pygame)

This project is part of my programming progress at **Penguin Academy**, where I implemented a **graph traversal algorithm** in a **visual maze environment** using **Pygame**.

## 🎯 Objective

Create a dynamic maze and use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find and visualize the shortest path from start to goal in a grid.

The maze is displayed graphically and updates as the algorithm explores and solves the path.

## 🧪 Technologies

- Language: Python
- Libraries: Pygame
- Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Output: Graphical window with animated pathfinding

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Install Pygame:
```bash
pip install pygame
